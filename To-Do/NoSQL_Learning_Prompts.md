# Cursor Prompts — NoSQL Learning (.NET Core)

Great decision — **Cursor AI + structured prompts = fastest learning**.

Below are **ready-to-paste Cursor prompts** for learning **NoSQL (.NET Core focused)** step-by-step with **notes + POC implementation**.

---

## Prompt 1 — NoSQL Basics Notes

Paste in Cursor:

```text
Act as a senior .NET architect and teach me NoSQL from a .NET developer perspective.

Explain in very simple terms:

1. What is NoSQL and why it is needed
2. Difference between SQL vs NoSQL in real-time production systems
3. Types of NoSQL databases with examples (Document, Key-Value, Column, Graph)
4. When to use SQL vs NoSQL in microservices architecture
5. Provide real-world examples from e-commerce systems

Give structured learning notes suitable for a 7-year experienced .NET developer preparing for interviews.
```

---

## Prompt 2 — MongoDB Fundamentals Notes

```text
Teach me MongoDB fundamentals for a .NET Core developer.

Explain:

1. MongoDB architecture (Database, Collection, Document)
2. BSON vs JSON
3. CRUD operations with examples
4. Schema design best practices
5. Embedded vs referenced documents with real-time examples

Give interview-ready notes and important points to remember.
```

## Prompt 3 — MongoDB .NET Core Integration POC

```text
Create a step-by-step .NET 8 Web API project using MongoDB.

Requirements:
1. Create Product model
2. Configure MongoDB connection using settings class
3. Implement MongoDbContext
4. Implement Repository pattern
5. Create Product CRUD APIs
6. Use dependency injection properly
7. Provide complete folder structure
8. Provide clean production-ready code with explanation

Explain every step clearly because I am learning MongoDB integration.
```

---

## Prompt 4 — MongoDB Advanced Features POC

```text
Enhance the existing MongoDB Product API with advanced production features:

1. Add indexing for frequently searched fields
2. Implement pagination
3. Implement search filtering
4. Implement aggregation example (total product count by category)
5. Explain performance benefits

Provide step-by-step implementation changes.
```

---

## Prompt 5 — Redis Caching .NET POC

```text
Create a step-by-step implementation to add Redis caching to an existing .NET Core Product API.

Requirements:
1. Configure Redis in .NET Core
2. Implement distributed caching
3. Cache Product List API
4. Implement cache invalidation when product is updated
5. Explain real-time production benefits

Provide production-ready code.
```

---

## Prompt 6 — Interview Preparation Prompt

```text
Act as a senior interviewer and ask advanced NoSQL interview questions for a 7-year experienced .NET developer.

Cover:
- MongoDB architecture
- Schema design decisions
- SQL vs NoSQL decisions
- Redis caching scenarios
- Performance optimization scenarios

Also provide ideal answers after each question.
```

---

## Very Important Tip (Power Use of Cursor)

After each POC prompt, run:

```text
Now convert this implementation into a small practice assignment for me so I can implement it myself step-by-step without copying code.
```

This makes you **actually learn**, not copy-paste.

---

## Learning Path Summary

1. **Prompt 1**: Understand NoSQL fundamentals and when to use it
2. **Prompt 2**: Learn MongoDB core concepts
3. **Prompt 3**: Build your first MongoDB .NET integration
4. **Prompt 4**: Add production-ready features (indexing, pagination, aggregation)
5. **Prompt 5**: Integrate Redis for distributed caching
6. **Prompt 6**: Prepare for interviews with advanced questions

---

## Notes

- Run prompts **one-by-one** in sequence
- After each POC, use the practice assignment prompt to reinforce learning
- Focus on understanding concepts, not just copying code
- Build each POC in a separate project or folder for clarity
